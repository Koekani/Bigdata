Given task:

Your task is to write a Python program that reads the two above described files and then computes and
prints out the following information (based on the logged information):

- What is the maximum number of different tracks listened by any single customer?
  Also print out the names of all customers (may be one or several) who listened
  to the maximum number of different tracks.
  
- By using the  Welch's t-test, print out a conclusion regarding the hypothesis that men and women
  listen to on average as many tracks. â€‹That is: is the average number of tracks listened to by men
   statistically significantly different from the average number of tracks listened to by women?
   
- By using the t-test between dependent samples, print out a conclusion regarding the hypothesis
  that users listen to as many tracks when connecting from a mobile device as when connecting from
  a non-mobile device.
